For convenience, this directory contains components of the The
Cooperative Computing Tools (cctools) that are needed by this
glideinWMS job wrapper (currently, just parrot_run).  Please see the

Most recently, the files in this directory were taken from cctools-21351a3c-x86_64-redhat5.
S.P.: On Sep.1.2015 binary files were updated from cctools-5.1.5-x86_64-redhat6
